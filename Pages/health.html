          Most of us can not go through our days without coffee or tea. The
          reason is that caffeine is a mild stimulant that affects the central
          nervous system and increases our alertness and energy levels. Due to
          that, caffeine consumption is progressive. The addiction is present
          among many. Also, unlike alcohol and other recreational drugs,
          caffeine does not attach any social stigma. So, liking caffeine
          becomes a dependence and addiction quickly. Read on to learn more
          about caffeine and its impact on health.

      <h3>What is Art Therapy and How Does it Help?</h3>

        Look around you. There is an art in everything, but how often do you
        actually pause to take a long look at it? In our busy lives, art and
        aesthetics generally take a back seat, and we often forget to appreciate
        the beauty of it. Art, both creating and admiring it, has also been
        scientifically proven to help with stress. It works as an excellent
        coping mechanism for many who struggle with negative emotions. Perhaps
        this is why art therapy is becoming increasingly popular with people
        from all generations.
