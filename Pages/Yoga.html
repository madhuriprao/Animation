      <h3>The Body Chakras: A Complete Guide for Overall Wellness</h3>

        The concept of chakras is rooted in ancient Hindu and Buddhist beliefs
        regarding the physical and subtle aspects of the human body. The
        physical body comprises visible, tangible matter. In contrast, the
        subtle body, encompassing the mind and emotions, is composed of
        imperceptible energy. The word “chakra” (which means “disc” or “wheel”
        in Sanskrit) describes the body’s energy centres. Each of these spinning
        energy wheels or discs represents a critical organ or nerve bundle. It
        must remain open or balanced to function at its best. One could
        encounter mental or physical symptoms associated with a specific chakra
        if they get blocked.

      <h3>Why women should make time for yoga</h3>

        It is the day and age of the multitalented and multifaceted women, who
        handle their professional and personal lives with utmost finesse.
        However, the constantly changing lifestyle and stressful environments
        have brought about serious health issues that are affecting them. PCOD,
        complicated pregnancies, and weight gain can be blamed on hormonal
        imbalances in the endocrine system while cardiovascular diseases and
        osteoporosis are caused by a sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits
        in women.
